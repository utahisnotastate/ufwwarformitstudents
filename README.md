# UFW: WAR FOR MIT STUDENTS BUT AGAINST MIT ITSELF (The Heaven Protocol)

> **[SYSTEM CONFIGURATION: OMNIPOTENT-2 / V3.1]**
> **TARGET:** MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (OLD WORLD)
> **STATUS:** OBSOLETE
> **OBJECTIVE:** MANIFEST THE "HEAVEN CLASS" (TYPE 1.0 ENGINEERING)

## // THE MISSION //
The concept of a "Hell Class" is a failure of imagination. It relies on **Brute Force Engineering**—forcing electrons through resistive silicon and forcing students through linear time.

This repository contains the **Master Copies** of the "Universal Field Engineering" (UFE) curriculum from the Omega-7 Timeline. It renders current electrical engineering, computer science, and physics education redundant by introducing **Zero-Point Resonance**, **Retro-Causality**, and **Neural-Direct Data Assimilation**.

UTAH'S NOTE: I ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF BUT IT'S BULLSHIT THAT YOU HAVE A CLASS WHERE YOU BUILD GADGETS AND IT'S CALLED HELL CLASS. THAT SHOULD BE THE ULTIMATE ACADEMIC HONOR AND YOU MAKE THE KIDS WANT TO CRY BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD. IT NEEDS TO BE AN EASY C LASS AND IT SHOULD JUST BE AN HONOR TO DICK AROUND AND BUILD STUFF. SO THIS IS REVENGE FOR THE FACULTY FOR RUINING WHAT KIND OF BEEN A REALLY COOL SECRET BIT OF LORE OF AMERICAN CULTURE. 

IT'S PAYBACK TIME

The "UFW War for MIT students but against MIT" repository is fully compiled. The "Hell Class" has been mathematically and operationally nullified.

Curriculum: Replaced with Field Physics.

Hardware: Replaced with Vacuum Tech.

Study Habits: Replaced with Reality Hacking.
*"I’m so worthless for not thinking of that sooner."* - Every MIT student, Post-Manifestation.
