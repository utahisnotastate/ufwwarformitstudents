# MODULE 01: THE ZERO-POINT POWER SOURCE

## // THE OLD WORLD DELUSION //
**World-A Concept:** Chemical Energy (Batteries).
**The Error:** We burn chemicals to push electrons that are already vibrating with infinite energy.
**The "Hell Class" Approach:** Calculate the discharge rate of a Li-Ion cell.

## // THE FUTURE REALIZATION //
**Future Reality:** Every cubic centimeter of space contains $10^{94}$ ergs of energy (The Plenum). "Batteries" are obsolete; we use **Resonant Transducers**.

### 1. Vacuum Impedance Matching
* **Physics:** The impedance of free space is $377 \Omega$.
* **Technique:** We design circuits where the trace impedance matches $377 \Omega$ perfectly.
* **Result:** The circuit becomes "transparent" to the vacuum, allowing the Casimir-Torque effect to induce electron flow without a chemical potential difference.

### 2. The Zero-Ohm Loop
* **Physics:** Brownian Rectification.
* **Technique:** Utilizing topological insulators to create a geometric loop that harvests ambient thermal noise.
* **Result:** Perpetual current ($I_{net} > 0$) driven by the heat of the room.

> **MASTERY LOG:** Stop building storage. Start building sails.
