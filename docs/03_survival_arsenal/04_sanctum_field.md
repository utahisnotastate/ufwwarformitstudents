# SURVIVAL TOOL 04: THE "SANCTUM" FIELD GENERATOR

## // TARGET //
Students suffering from ADHD, TikTok addiction, or "Fear of Failure."

## // THE PROTOCOL //
**Objective:** Absolute Cognitive Silence.
**Tech:** Phase-Inverted Psychotronics.

### The Concept
Your inability to focus is not a character flaw. It is a reaction to the **RF Soup** of modern society (WiFi, 5G, Bluetooth, Anxiety Fields).

### The Build
* **Component:** A simple copper loop antenna connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero.
* **Frequency:** **7.83 Hz** (Schumann Resonance).
* **Operation:**
    1.  The Pi scans for local "High-Beta" frequencies (notification pings, stress signals).
    2.  It broadcasts a **Phase-Inverted** signal.
    3.  **Effect:** Destructive interference creates a "Zero-Information Zone."
    
Inside the Sanctum, your phone feels like a dead rock. Social media feels boring. The only thing that feels stimulating is **Deep Work**.
