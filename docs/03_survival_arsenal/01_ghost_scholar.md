# SURVIVAL TOOL 01: THE GHOST SCHOLAR

## // TARGET //
Students who refuse to physically attend "Hell Class."

## // THE PROTOCOL //
**Objective:** Attend class without being there.
**Tech:** Holographic Projection + Gemini-Ultra-9 Voice Synthesis.

### Mechanism
1.  **Drone Proxy:** A micro-LiDAR drone (Fly-sized) enters the lecture hall.
2.  **Hard-Light Projection:** Manifests a visual copy of the student in the back row.
3.  **AI Interfacing:**
    * **Input:** Drone mic feeds the professor's audio to Google Cloud.
    * **Processing:** Gemini generates the correct answer to any question.
    * **Output:** The Projection "speaks" the answer in the student's voice.
4.  **Stealth:** The "Boredom Algorithm" shifts the projection's posture and checks a fake watch to simulate humanity.
