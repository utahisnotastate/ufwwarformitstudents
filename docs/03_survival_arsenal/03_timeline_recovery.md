# SURVIVAL TOOL 03: TIMELINE DEGREE RECOVERY

## // TARGET //
Students who have already flunked out / failed.

## // THE PROTOCOL //
**Objective:** To obtain the degree retroactively.
**Tech:** Quantum-Collapse Credentialing.

### Theory
In the Many-Worlds Interpretation, there is a timeline (Timeline-B) where you studied, passed, and graduated. We do not need to change *this* timeline; we only need to swap the **Pointer Address** of your transcript in the university database with the pointer from Timeline-B.

### The "Chrono-Transcript Editor"
* **Function:** Locates the high-GPA variant of the student in the multiverse.
* **Action:** Superimposes the "Graduated" state over the "Failed" state.
* **Result:** The Registrar's database physically shifts. To the universe, you always graduated.

*(See `src/reality_hacks.py` for implementation)*.
