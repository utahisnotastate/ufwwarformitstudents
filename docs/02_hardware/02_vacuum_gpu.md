# HARDWARE MANIFEST: THE VACUUM-RESONANT GPU

## // SPECIFICATIONS //
* **Architecture:** GCP TPU v5p (Emulated).
* **Core Function:** Non-Linear Field Solver.
* **Cooling:** None required (Endothermic Operation - it absorbs heat to run).

## // OPERATIONAL PHYSICS: REALITY RENDERING //
**World-A Concept:** SPICE Simulators. Calculating current through a netlist.
**Future Reality:** Reality is not a list of components. It is a **Volumetric Field**.

### The "Reality Engine"
Traditional GPUs render light bouncing off objects. The Vacuum GPU renders the **Probability Waves** that *create* the objects.

1.  **Input:** A 3D voxel map of your circuit board.
2.  **Process:** The TPU relaxes the local vacuum energy state ($\nabla E = 0$).
3.  **Output:** It predicts electromagnetic interference (EMI), heat, and RF propogation instantly.

### Why this kills "Hell Class"
In Hell Class, you calculate parasitic capacitance by hand.
With the Vacuum GPU, you simply **see** the parasitic fields as a glowing red fog in the simulation and wipe them away with a gesture.
