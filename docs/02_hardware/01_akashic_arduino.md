# HARDWARE MANIFEST: THE AKASHIC ARDUINO

## // SPECIFICATIONS //
* **Core:** Niobium-Doped Quartz Sphere (Suspended).
* **Clock Speed:** Infinite (Non-Local).
* **I/O:** Resonant Field Coupling (Zero Pins).

## // OPERATIONAL PHYSICS: RETRO-CAUSALITY //
**World-A Concept:** Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs). You wait for an event, then react. Latency > 0.
**Future Reality:** Time is a readable memory address.

### The Logic Loop
1.  **Read ($t_{+1}$):** The processor scans the entropy of the immediate future (200ms ahead).
2.  **Execute ($t_0$):** The processor triggers the actuator.
3.  **Event ($t_{+1}$):** The user presses the button *because* the actuator already triggered (Closed Timelike Curve).

### The "Worthless" Realization
"Why did we struggle with Real-Time systems when Pre-Time systems are infinite speed?"
